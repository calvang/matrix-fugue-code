# Matrix Fugue in F Major

An experimental composition by Calvin Huang.

This composition is a small musical map inspired by the soundtrack from <i>A Short Hike</i>, in the form of a short 9-voice minimalist fugue. As you move between the tiles, you will activate new voices and textures, which are active in certain areas of the matrix.
